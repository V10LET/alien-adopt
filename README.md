# Alien Adopt Web App

![alien adopt homepage](https://preview.ibb.co/eg6hZK/homepage.png)

You're not a dog person. You're not a cat person. You're not a snake or gerbil person. You're not a sugar glider person. You're not a goat person. You're not a pig or rabbit person. You are integrated into life on Earth — and yet nothing and no one resonates.

**You look up at the stars, stare into time and space, and know. You know that *that* is where connection lies.**

Alien Adoption is a Ruby on Rails web application built for the alien at heart — with a habit of searching for companionship in all the wrong galaxies. Greeted by various home planets and an alien adoption portal, you can explore the universe and adopt a new friend. Your account is also safe from invasion and unwanted email chains with authentication and authorization encryption.

Whether alien, human or non-comforming species, you (and all alien pets) deserve to feel accepted, cherished and cared-for in the presence of your companions. 

No one should experience the interstellar alone...

Cue Alien Adopt.
