You're not a dog person. You're not a cat person. You're not a snake or gerbil person. You're not a sugar glider person. You're not a goat person. You're not a pig or rabbit person. You are integrated into life on Earth — and yet nothing and no one resonates.

**You look up at the stars, stare into time and space, and know. You know that *that* is where connection lies.**

Alien Adoption is a Ruby on Rails web application built for the alien at heart — with a habit of searching for companionship in all the wrong galaxies. Greeted by various home planets and an alien adoption portal, you can explore the universe and adopt a new friend. Your account is also safe from invasion and unwanted email chains with authentication and authorization encryption.

Whether alien, human or non-conforming species, you (and all alien pets) deserve to feel accepted, cherished and cared-for in the presence of your companions. 

No one should experience the interstellar alone...

Cue Alien Adopt.

## Instructions
Although not currently hosted on a public server, you can clone the web app to your computer. Once you have the the "alien-adopt" file open in your terminal, you will want to install (bundle install) the app's gems, and migrate (rake db:migrate) and seed (rake db:seed) the database — all in your command line. Lastly, type "rails s" in the command line and you're off to adopt an alien in your preferred browser using a local server.
