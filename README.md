You're not a dog person. You're not a cat person. You're not a snake or gerbil person. You're not a sugar glider person. You're not a goat person. You're not a pig or rabbit person.

You are integrated into life on Earth â€” and yet nothing and no one resonates. You look up at the stars, stare into time and space, and know. You know that that's where your "people" are.
